# doctors-portal-server
This is a doctors portal website. I have listed below some features of it.
=> Users can make an appointment by selecting the date and time.
=> User and Admin can Sign Up and log into the website. There is an alternate way to log in with Google Sign In.
=> Users can see only his/her appointment date and time after login.
=> Admin can add doctors.
=> Doctors are the admin here. They can see the specific date appointments by selecting a date on the Dashboard. Even they can see all the patient's appointments in detail by clicking 'Patients' tab on Dashboard.
